# Assignment 1

## Setup Instructions

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
cd assignment1
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/macOS
# venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
```

2. Install the required packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run tests with pytest

```bash
pytest
```

4. Run main script

```bash 
python src/reverse_words.py
```

# Assignment 2
## I treated Assignment 2 as a refactoring of code in a pseudo codebase, so I did not add any additional env file / requirements.txt to run it
## Created each commit to show my thought process and how I would have split up my commits for refactoring (like in a real job situation)
